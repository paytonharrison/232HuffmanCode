# 232HuffmanCode

Huffman code is an algorithm to compress data. It becomes possible to store large files as smaller sets of data. Save significant space in large files by recording which characters/letters are the most frequently used in a character table, when encoding the message via binary tree. To decode message, read binary tree to go back to the original message.
